|-> **Predicted Bar Change** - hold an item in your hand to see how much Hunger or Hydration you will receive from it  
\ -> **Saturation Bar** - a bar over the Food bar that shows your saturation (the amount of Hunger you need to consume before having to eat again)
 - **Hide Scoreboard Sidebar** - Removed the Scoreboard and moved it to the HUD.
